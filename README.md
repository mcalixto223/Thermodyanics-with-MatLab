Problem Solving Thermodynamics with MATLAB 
An ideal steam turbine uses 6000 kg/h   of steam. The steam is superheated to 720°C   and 4000 kPa   
when supplied to the turbine. The exhaust temperature is 80°C  , and the fluid leaving the condenser 
is assumed to be a saturated liquid. Determine the power generated by the cycle, the rate of heat rejected, 
the amount of coal consumed if the boiler unit is assumed to be 100% effective while the LHV of coal
is 30,000 kJ/kg, and the steam rate.
